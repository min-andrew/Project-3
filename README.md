# Dog-tor's Notes


## Description

This application is for dog owners who would like an easy and informative app to track their dog’s health. This app allows users to monitor various aspects of their dog’s health, such as their medical appointments, issues, concerns, and daily habits. There is also a web store for products that improve their dog’s wellbeing.

<br>
For this application, we used the following technologies: React, GraphQL, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Heroku, Cloudinary,  Nodemon, along with JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, and more.
<br><br>

Some of the challenges we faced in creating this app included connecting to the backend and using GraphQL for the first time on a MERN project. We had some struggles with Cloudinary. And working with Semantic UI turned out to be quite limiting, due to their CSS library overruling our own. 
<br><br>
In the future, we would like:
 - Add a calendar and reminders for important dates, appointments, and habits. 
 - Add an area to upload/access sensitive information (pictures of insurance card).
 - Link vet notes to each pet's profile.
 - Add a storefront
 - Include health tips for dog owners.
